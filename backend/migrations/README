## Running Migrations

### Local Development

1. Generate migration script:
```
cd backend
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
```

2. Apply migration:
```
alembic upgrade head
```

### Vercel Deployment

Migrations in Vercel need to be run manually before deployment using:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_db_url alembic upgrade head
```

This should be done after each schema change.
